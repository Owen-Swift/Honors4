-Make a function that takes an integer input, performs the factorial, and returns the result to main
-Then make a function that saves main to a text file

Approach:
	-input int to first function, move to ecx
	-use mul ecx, loop to perform factorial
	-function leaves factorial in eax

	-for second function, divide eax by ten
	-remainder is saved to edx
	-add edx, '0'
	-write edx to output file (append)
